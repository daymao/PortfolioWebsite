        <p class="about-paragraph"> 
            I am a senior Computer Science student at the University of Florida. <br>
            This past summer I completed a Software Engineering internship at Salesforce <br>
            where I worked on the backend of an Order Management system. <br>
            I like to program with Python, Java, C++, Javascript and HTML/CSS <br>
            and I have a few personal projects that I developed with some of these languages.<br>
            <br>
            Outside of school, I enjoy learning new things, exercising, playing sports, and volunteering. <br>
            Whether it be something related to software or something related to exercise, <br>
            I am always learning. I hope you enjoy looking through my website and feel free <br>
            to contact me any time!

                <br>
                <p>This is a task list planner website that I developed using
                   Javascript, HTML and CSS. In the website, you can create lists for different groups, 
                   such as "Work" or "Job Searching".
                   Within the lists you can create tasks, which when completed, you can check 
                   off and delete them. You can also delete any lists you no longer want. 
                   Click the name of the app to go to the website.

                <br>
                <p>This is an interactive website in which I show some of my favorite
                    shows and characters in those shows. I made this website with
                      Javascript, HTML, and CSS. If you hover over the 
                     character cards, they will flip over and show you some information 
                     about the the character. 
                     Click the name of the app to go to the page.

                <br>
                <p> This a website that a team of three UF students and myself developed.
                    The link above is to the project's repository, which is in one of the 
                    other team member's GitHub.In this website we use the Google Maps API to 
                    map out energy data about each of the counties in Florida. The purpose of the project is to act as a prototype
                    for an energy company to figure out where new power plants and renewable energy
                    power plants should be placed within Florida.
